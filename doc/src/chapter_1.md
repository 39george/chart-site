# Chapter 1

Lets imagine chart-site. This site will contain ONE page. Page with songs.
On that page, there are table with songs, so we need to fetch these songs, and
we want to use sorting when fetch songs. Because there are not so much songs, we can
just return list with all songs.

1. Endpoint to return list with all songs.

We want to somehow upload songs to the server.

2. Endpoint to upload new song, this endpoint should be protected with middleware auth.
3. Auth will work with preconfigured account.
